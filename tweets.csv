@mehdirhasan “Dangerous move”? The US has been providing lethal aid to Ukraine for years now. New sanctions by the US have crippled the Russian economy and devalued the Ruble. Biden mentioning “regime change” is the least provoking move thus far. It seems quite obvious even in the Kremlin lol,0,0,1,Migs,@MLGRaZr,,['@mehdirhasan']

"Did Biden call for ""regime change"" in Russia, or was he signaling to the Russian elite that Putin's departure would lay the groundwork for a bargain (and perhaps save their position)? Exploiting cracks in the elite rather than calling for popular uprising?
